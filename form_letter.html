 form_letter = %{

     <title>Thank You!</title>

       Political activism is at the heart of any democracy and your voice needs to be heard.
       Please consider reaching out to your following representatives:
     </p>
     
     <table>
       <tr><th>Legislators</th></tr>
       <tr><td>LEGISLATORS</td></tr>
     </table>
   </body>
 </html>
}

The "form_letter = %{html_doc}" allows us to store the template as a large
string in our current application.

Ruby has a few ways to define strings.
This format %{ String Contents} is once choice when defining a string that
spans multiple lines.

However placing this large blob of text within our application will
make it much more difficult to understand the template and the application
code and thus make it more difficult to change the template and application
code individually.

Instead of including the template within our application, we could instead
load the template using the File tools!

It is important to define the form_letter.html in the root of the project
directory and not in the lib directory. This is because when the application
runs it assumes the place that you started the application is where all
the file references will be located. Later, we move the file to a new location
and are more explicit on defining the location of the template.
